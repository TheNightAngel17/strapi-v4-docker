# Introduction to this repo
So i was pretty annoyed that with v4 of Strapi, there was no docker options, so I decided to go out and just build it the way I wanted. Feel free to use this implementation of Strapi - I'll try and make it as configurable as possible.

## I'm just here for DockerHub repo please
[mlxdev/strapi-v4-docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mlxdev/strapi-v4-docker)

## Why even go down this road?
Well, i've been trying to get my homelab up and running specifically with kubernetes, and I wanted to be able to self-host a headless cms. With this docker project, I am able to create [this helm chart]() and deploy a highly available Strapi service on kubernetes!

## How I go to this state
I basically followed [these steps](https://blog.dehlin.dev/docker-with-strapi-v4) to get the main generic Strapi up and running with docker.

I then started messing around with the config files to add more customization.

## What's on the docket
- add usefull plugins
- configureable media storage

## Current Environment Variables
Below are a list of different environment variables grouped by usage location. Some of which I am purposfully not setting a default for because you should create them seperatly for security and ctryptogrophy reasons.

A .env.example has ben supplied in this repo, but please, for the love of god, __change the values__. Keep your applications safe
